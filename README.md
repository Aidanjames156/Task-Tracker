# TaskTracker CLI

A simple command-line tool for managing your personal tasks. Tasks are stored locally in a JSON file (`tasks.json`).

## Features

- List all tasks, or filter by status (`todo`, `in-progress`, `done`)
- Update the description of existing tasks
- Delete tasks by their ID
- Mark tasks as "in-progress" or "done"
- Tracks creation and update timestamps for each task

## Usage

Run the script using Python:

```sh
python task_cli.py <command> [arguments]
```

### Commands

- `add "description"` — Add a new task
